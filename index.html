      <h2>Album Descriptions:</h2>
      <p> Donda is the tenth studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on August 29, 2021, by GOOD Music and Def Jam Recordings. It features vocal contributions from several artists. Production was handled by West, BoogzDaBeast, E.Vax, Gesaffelstein, Jeff Bhasker, Mike Dean, among others. The album was initially set for release on July 24, 2020, but was delayed multiple times. In July 2021, West set up a provisional recording studio at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, where listening events were held on July 22 and August 5. A third listening event was held at Soldier Field in Chicago on August 26.
        Donda is primarily a hip hop and gospel album, drawing elements from West's previous work, including progressive rap, pop and trap, as well as influences of boom bap, drill, electropop, hip house and industrial hip hop. It has been described as both "minimalist" and "maximalist", with a reduced presence of drums in the production. The album is darker in lyrical content than West's previous efforts, exploring religion, as well as addiction and West's ego, mental instability, relationships with his family, his divorce from Kim Kardashian and his mother Donda C. West, after whom the album is named.
        Donda divided music critics upon release; many felt the album was overlong and lacking in coherence, though a few considered it to be superior to his previous albums Ye (2018) and Jesus Is King (2019). The album also attracted controversy for the guest appearances by DaBaby and Marilyn Manson on the track "Jail, Pt. 2", due to their allegations of homophobia and abuse respectively. It was commercially successful, debuting at number one on several charts, including the ARIA Charts and UK Albums Chart, and becoming one of the all-time biggest debuts on streaming services Spotify and Apple Music. </p>

      <p> Certified Lover Boy is the sixth studio album by Canadian rapper Drake. It was released on September 3, 2021, through OVO Sound and Republic Records. The album was initially set to be released in January 2021, but was delayed.[1] It features guest appearances by Lil Baby, Lil Durk, Giveon, Jay-Z, Travis Scott, Future, Young Thug, Yebba, 21 Savage, Project Pat, Tems, Ty Dolla Sign, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross and Kid Cudi. Thematically, Drake explained that Certified Lover Boy is "a combination of toxic masculinity and acceptance of truth which is inevitably heartbreaking".[2] </p>
      
      <h2>Certified Review by a Qualified Expert (me):</h2>

      <p>Honestly, I did not get to finish listening through Certified Lover Boy because the first couple of songs
        were pretty <strong>boring</strong> and did <strong>not</strong> capture my attention. Due to that objective fact, Donda is a superior album.
